  “SYMPOSIUM [Greek: συμποσιον] = a convivial meeting, usually following a dinner, for drinking and intellectual conversation”<br />
  </span>

  The series of “Computing π-Conjugated Compounds" (CπC) symposia offers an informal forum for the discussion of the latest research results in the domain of π-conjugated systems, covering the fields of functional materials, photochemistry, biochemistry, theory and computation.

  The CπC symposium series started in 2010 in Valencia and have been taking place since then on a yearly basis.
  In 2017, we have created a society to support the activity of the network and help in the organization of the symposium.
  Everyone is welcome to join and become a member!<br />
